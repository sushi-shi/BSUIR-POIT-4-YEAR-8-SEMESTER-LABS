# Things of note:
* learn how other people use Iced in these situations with many disjoint widgets
* see how to implement our own widgets
* understand what are tradeoffs of using "message based" gui compared to a more general "closure based" ones
* l10n/i18n with gettext and maybe other utils. The docs weren't exactly clear, so I skipped those, still I wonder.

# Compiling
* install `nix`
* run `nix-shell`
* run `cargo run`
